# Hi ðŸ‘‹! My name is Sebastian, I'm Front-end Developer


âž¤ An IT student of the third year who is currently seeking his first commercial experience in the form of an internship or apprenticeship in the field of front-end/full stack programming.

 
âž¤ I have been actively building my skills in frontend development through a combination of academic coursework and self-directed learning. I have gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and recently started exploring React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects.
